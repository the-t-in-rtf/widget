# Unified Listing API

The Unified Listing is a federated database of products, including those focused on Assistive Technology users as well as mainstream products

This API allows developers to read, create, and update records stored in the Unified Listing.

This document describes the REST API, including the syntax required to use all commands, and the format of all data to be passed into and returned from the API.

# Data Objects
This section describes the data objects which are accepted by and returned by the Unified Listing API.

## Product Records

A product is a distinct piece of software or equipment.  Products may have more than one version or edition, which may provide different features.  For more information about editions (versions or models of a product), see the ["Editions"](#editions) section.

All products in the Unified Listing have the following common fields:

|Field|Description|Required?|
| --- | --- | --- |
|source|The source of this record.  If the record is provided by a source database, this field will be set to a unique string identifying the source.  If this record is unique to the Unified Listing, this field will be set to "ul".|Y|
|sid|The unique identifier to identify this record in the source database.|Y|
|uid|The Universal ID ("uid") is an id that is unique in the Unified listing and which is constant for different editions of a product (see ["editions"](#editions)).  "Source" records use this field to indicate which "unified" record they are associated with (if any).|Y|
|name|The name of the product.|Y|
|description|A description of the product.|Y|
|manufacturer|A JSON object describing the manufacturer (see ["Manufacturer"](#manufacturers) below).|Y|
|status|The status of this record.  Current supported values are listed below under ["Statuses"](#statuses).|Y|
|images|Images of the product, if available (see ["Images"](#images) below).|N|
|language|The language used in the text of this record, expressed using a two letter language, code, an underscore, and a two letter country code, as in `en_us` or `it_it`.  If this is not specified, `en_us` is assumed.|N|
|updated|The date at which the record was last updated.|Y|

## Source Records

The Unified Listing contains source records pulled from sources such as [EASTIN](http://www.eastin.eu/) and [GARI](http://www.gari.info/), represented as JSON objects.

In addition to the fields described in ["Product Records"](#product-records), a source record includes the following additional fields:

|Field|Description|Required?|
| --- | --- | --- |
|sourceData|The original source record represented as a JSON object.  As a source database may have any fields they like, so there are no other restrictions on this field.|Y|


A JSON representation of a source record with all fields looks as follows:

## Unified Listing Records

The Unified Listing also contains "unified" records, which are a summary in US English of one or more source records.  In addition to the fields mentioned in ["Product Records"](#product-records), a "unified" record supports the following additional fields:

|Field|Description|Required?|
| --- | --- | --- |
|sources| An array containing a list of "source" records (see ["Source Records"](#source-records) above).|Y|
|editions| A hash containing one or more "editions" of the product (see ["Editions"](#editions) below).  At least one edition named "default" is required.|Y|
|ontologies| A hash containing one or more "ontologies", or ways of classifying the product (see ["Ontologies"](#ontologies) below.)|

A full "unified" record in JSON format looks something like:

    {
        "source":           "ul",
        "uid":              "com.maker.win7.sample",
        "sid":              "com.maker.win7.sample",
        "name":             "A Sample Unified Listing Record",
        "description":      "A record that combines 2-3 additional records' worth of information."
        "manufacturer":     {
            "name":             "Maker Software",
            "address":          "4806 Hope Valley Road\nDurham, NC, 27707\nUnited States",

            "url":              "http://www.maker.com/"
        },
        "status":           "active",

    }

## Statuses

The Unified Listing has a simple workflow to manage the lifecycle of all products.  The status field indicates which step in the workflow the product is currently at.

The following table describes the allowed statutes and when they are to be used.

|Status|Description|
| --- | --- |
|new|A product that has just been added and which has not been reviewed.|
|active|A product that has been reviewed and which is currently available.|
|discontinued|A product which is no longer being produced (but which may still be available on the used market).|
|deleted|A product record which was has been deleted for administrative reasons.  Should only be used for duplicates or mistakenly-created records.  For products that are no longer available, use "discontinued" instead.|

[View JSON Schema for statuses](../../schema/status.json)

## Manufacturers

The company or individual that produces a product is called a "manufacturer" in the Unified Listing.  The following table describes the available fields and how they are to be used.

|Field|Description|Required?|
| --- | --- | --- |
|name           | The name of the manufacturer.|Y|
|address        | The street address of the manufacturer (may also be used for the complete address).|N|
|postalCode     | The postal code (ZIP code, etc.) of the manufacturer.|N|
|cityTown       | The city/town in which the manufacturer is located.|N|
|provinceRegion | The province/region in which the manufacturer is located.|N|
|country        | The country in which the manufacturer is located.|N|
|phone          | The phone number of the manufacturer.|N|
|email          | An email address at which the manufacturer can be contacted.|N|
|url            | The manufacturer's web site.|N|

 A JSON representation of a manufacturer with all fields looks as follows:

    "manufacturer":     {
        "name":             "Maker Software",
        "address":          "4806 Hope Valley Road\nDurham, NC, 27707\nUnited States",
        "postalCode":       "27707",
        "cityTown":         "Durham",
        "provinceRegion":   "North Carolina",
        "country":          "United States",
        "phone":            "(704) 555-1212",
        "email":            "maker@maker.com",
        "url":              "http://www.maker.com/"
    }

## Images

Many of the databases we federate include pictures with a product listing.  If available, we store this information in the `images` field of a source record.  This field is an array, there can be multiple images for a single product.  We need two pieces of information about each image. First, we need a URL where the image can be found.  Second, we need text we can use to describe the image for screen readers.  Each entry looks roughly like:

    {
      "url": "http://www.vlibank.be/scan.jsp?PID=A10149&TYPE=jpg&RANG=A&SIZE=medium",
      "description": "Mini Joystick with Push - / USB"
    }

## Ontologies

There are many ways of classifying products and product features.  In the Unified Listing, we provide support for multiple ontologies without proscribing a set format.  The only thing that is required is that the ontology itself have a key which is unique within the given record.

Here is an example of the ontologies section of a product represented in JSON format (based on the data we have from EASTIN):

    "ontologies": {
        "iso9999": {
            "primaryCode": "22.39.12",
            "secondaryCodes": [ "22.39.07" ]
        }
    }

## Editions

A software product may have various versions or editions that operate on different platforms.  A physical device may have multiple editions that provide different features.

Each variation on the product that has different features is an "edition" of the product.  Variations that are only cosmetically different (such as different colors) should not need to have more than one edition.

An edition is required to have a unique key.  There must be at least one edition, called "default" which is used when the version or variation is otherwise unknown.

The simplest set of editions represented in JSON format looks something like the following:

    editions: {
        "default": {
            "contexts": {
                "OS": [{
                        "id": "android",
                        "version": ">=0.1"
                    }]
            },
            "settingsHandlers": [
                {
                    "type": "gpii.settingsHandlers.noSettings",
                    "capabilities": [
                        "display.screenReader",
                        "applications.com\\.android\\.freespeech.id",
                        "display.screenReader.applications.com\\.android\\.freespeech.name"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "lifecycleManager": {
                "start": [
                    {
                        "type": "gpii.androidActivityManager.startFreespeech"
                    }
                ],
                "stop": [
                    {
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
